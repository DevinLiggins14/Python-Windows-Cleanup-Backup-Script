# Python-Windows-Cleanup-Script
<h2>Description</h2>
<br/> 
This project demonstrates a Python script designed to clean up unnecessary and junk files on a Windows 10 system. The script automates the process of identifying and removing temporary files, logs, and other clutter that can accumulate over time, helping to free up disk space and improve system performance.

| **Windows 10 VM**      | Provides the testing environment for script development and execution.      |
| **Python 3.9+**        | Required to run the cleanup script.                                         |
| **os & shutil Modules**| Used for file system operations like identifying and deleting files.        |
| **Custom Junk File Script** | Generates a cluttered environment to simulate real-world conditions.   |



## Step 1: Run the junk file script

<br/> 
Project workflow: 
Prerequisite Setup: A separate script will be executed to generate junk files within a Windows 10 virtual machine, simulating a cluttered environment for testing.
Script Development and Testing: The Python cleanup script will be developed and iteratively tested to ensure it identifies and removes the junk files effectively.
Documentation: Detailed steps and images will illustrate the process, from creating the junk files to running the cleanup script and verifying its success.
